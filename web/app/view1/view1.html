<p style="margin-top: 10px;color:#105cb6;font-style: italic; font-size: large">This seed shows a "typical" layout for an application that requires authentication and uses
  <b>ROLES</b> to distinguish between what authenticated users can do.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b style="display: inline-block;width:7em;">View1</b> Can be seen by all</li>
  <li><b style="display: inline-block;width:7em;">View2</b> Access to data (REST) requires user to be authenticated as a <em>User</em></li>
  <li><b style="display: inline-block;width:7em;">View3</b> Access to data (REST) requires user to be authenticated as an <em>Admin</em></li>
</ul>
<h3>Test Users: (logon with these credentials to test authentication)</h3>
<p>The Backend supports whatever roles you come up with. Out of the box the front-end only handles the roles "User" and "Admin". Admin more is however relatively simple</p>
<ul style="font-size: large">
  <li><b style="display: inline-block;width:7em;">User</b>username = user, password = test</li>
  <li><b style="display: inline-block;width:7em;">Admin:</b>username = admin, password = test</li>
  <li><b style="display: inline-block;width:7em;">User+Admin:</b>username = user_admin, password = test</li>
</ul>
<h3>Using the Security Features in this seed - <em>Server:</em></h3>
<p>Decorate your REST classes and or methods with theese annotations: <em>@PermitAll</em> <em>@DenyAll</em> <em>@RolesAllowed</em>
<p>See the section Securing RESTful Web Services Using Annotations here: <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E24329_01/web.1211/e24983/secure.htm#RESTF256">Securing RESTful Web Services</a>
<P>The server package <b>rest</b> provides examples of services using both the <em>User</em> and <em>Admin</em> Roles</p>
<p>Username, password, and roles are hardcoded in UserFacade.java and the User Class (your task is to place this info in a database)</p>

<h3>Using the Security Features in this seed - <em>Client</em>:</h3>
<p>Logon/logof is ready to use.</p>
<p>A token with credentials is automatically attached to all outgoing AJAX (REST)requests (when you are logged on) </p>
<p>In this version users can see all menu items (even if they do not have the necessary rights). This is for you to

  observe when and where security takes place (bring up F12 in chrome and monitor the network traffic)<p>
<p>You can hide elements (menu-items) so they are only visible when logged on with the required security role. Add <code>ng-show="isUser"</code> to
  the "view2" anchor tag in index.html and <code>ng-show="isAdmin"</code> on the "view2" tag. To see this in action.</p>
<p>Everything you do, that relates to security on the client, can be tampered with, so the trick above should be seen as
  something to make the system more user friendly. <span style="text-decoration: underline">The real security is how REST (our data) is protected on the server. </span>
